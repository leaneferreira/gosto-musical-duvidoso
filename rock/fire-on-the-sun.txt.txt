All the shame you gave me just won't ever be gone
All the pain you gave me, baby, it's like fire on the Sun
Fire on the Sun

All my friends got to tell me you was gone for good
Your friends all tell the truth, they'd lie if they could
They'd lie if they could
Yeah fire!

Your love is like magic, turn me on, turn me on
Your love is good just like fire on the Sun
Fire on the Sun

Fire on the Sun
Your love is like fire, baby, yeah
On the Sun
Yeah, I say it's it's hot, so hot, hot, so hot

Fire on the Sun
Your love is like fire, baby, yeah
On the Sun
I say it's like fire on the Sun
